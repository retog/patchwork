## v3.18.0 - 2020-06-03

### Added

- Support for DHT invites as generated by
  [manyverse](https://gitlab.com/staltz/manyverse) (#1246) added by @staltz.
  This is the headline feature of this release. DHT invites are one of the more
  promising ways to improve the onboarding experience without a pub.
  We invite everyone to test this feature out. Invite a friend or family member
  to SSB, tell us how it worked, we're eager to iterate on this!
- Show last user activity on profile pages and mouse-over popups (#1289, #1290)
- Add [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com)-inspired theme (#1294, #1295)
- You can now type `/profile` into the search bar to visit your own profile.
  (#1287) Handy in combination with using `Ctrl+L` (`Cmd+L` on MacOS) to
  activate the search bar.
- When using `Ctrl/Cmd+Return` to publish a message, a second push of
  `Ctrl/Cmd+Return` will now confirm the publication, while `Esc` or simply
  `Return` (without the `Ctrl/Cmd` modifier) will cancel the publish and return
  back to editing the message (#1286)

- Changelog.

### Changed
- Made legacy block handling easier to understand with new options on the profile page.

- Replaced "Search with Google" with "Search with DuckDuckGo" in the context menu.
- Started using an experimental branch of ssb-config that automatically configures multiple network interfaces so that they can be broadcast correctly by multiserver.

### Removed
- Irrelevant prebuilds from build artifacts, which were bloating the size of releases.

### Fixed
- Problem where Patchwork would prompt user to add a name and description even when it wasn't their first time opening the application.
- Pagination bug that wasn't correctly showing messages on private, public, and profile feeds.
- EXIF stripping, which only works on JPG, TIF, and WAV files. Images that were converted from JPG/TIF/WAV may still have EXIF metadata embedded somewhere in the file, so it's important to know that Patchwork only rmeoves EXIF metadata from JPG/TIF/WAV.
